### McKinnie's Travels

In 2018, I had the privilege of working in the Republic of Ireland for several months.

I am originally from North Carolina, and after bringing some family out to visit, I noticed an astounding number of Irish townships that shared names with prominent streets and neighborhoods within the North Carolina cities where family has lived.

With data collection help from family members, I created a visualization which connects a significant number of Irish towns to North Carolina streets that were likely named after them.

The visualization technique was inspired by [this visualization by Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-islamic-golden-age-thinkers-discovered-long-before-the-west/)
