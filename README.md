Hi World!
Iâ€™m Robin McKinnie and I'm a data analyst and information designer working in Austin,TX. 

When I'm not working on a cool side project or sharpening my design skills, 
I am scouring the city for new parks and old funk records.

### McKinnie's Travels

In 2018, I had the privelige of working in the Republic of Ireland for several months.

I am originally from North Carolina, and after bringing some family out to visit, I noticed an astounding number of Irish townships that shared names with prominent streets and neighborhoods within the North Carolina cities that my family has lived in.

With data collection help from family members, I created a visualization which shows a significant number of Irish towns, and North Carolina streets that were likely named after them.

Visualization technique inspired by
